== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why my custom media taxonomy's page is 404? =

Try to just re-save permalinks settings. Go to Settings >> Permalinks and push "Save Changes" button.

= Why Media Popup of some themes/plugins does not show taxonomy filters? =

EML adds its filters to ANY media popup that already contains native WordPress filters. We chose NOT to force adding filters to ANY media popup because there are a lot of cases when filters are not acceptable and theme's/plugin's author did not add them intentionally.

If you believe that a third-party plugin shoud have filters in its Media Popup please contact its author with a request to add NATIVE WordPress filters ([example of the code](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-can-we-use-this-plugin-features-in-my-custom-plugin-media-uploader?replies=15#post-5753212) for theme's/plugin's authors).

= How to show images per media category on a webpage =

Right now it is possible via WP_Query ([example of the code](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-displaying-an-array-of-images-per-category-or-categories)). We are working on a gallery based on EML taxonomies.
